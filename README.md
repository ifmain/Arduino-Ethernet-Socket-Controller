# Arduino-Ethernet-Socket-Controller

Arduino Ethernet Socket Controller is an Arduino sketch designed for controlling relays over the internet using an Ethernet gateway. This project enables users to create a web interface for managing an electronic device connected to the relay.

Key features of the project include:

1. **Remote Control:** Users can toggle the relay state via a web interface, allowing them to remotely turn connected devices on or off.

2. **Network Settings Configuration:** The project provides the capability to configure IP address, DNS, gateway, and subnet via the web interface, offering flexibility in setting up the network connection.

3. **State Monitoring:** With the state monitoring feature, users can set up the device to monitor the availability of another device on the network through ping. This enables automatic rebooting or toggling of the relay based on the status of the monitored device.

4. **Password Authentication:** The project includes basic password authentication to ensure secure access to the control web interface.

This sketch can be valuable for creating a smart home, remotely controlling electronic devices, or automating processes in an industrial environment. It offers a simple and flexible solution for managing electronics over the internet.
